![Welcome Page](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30848819/236518946-ff46ceba-93e4-4fd0-bb05-d08abf648c63.png)
Here it is the monorepo of the fullstack project of an App where users can create an account in order to:
- Create notes
- List the notes
- View each note content
- Edit notes
- Delete notes
  
All using full stack tecnologies:
- **Backend**: The use of *FastAPI* with *Python*.
- **Frontend**: The use of *Next.js* with Typescript.
- **UI/UX (Extra)**: The apply of knowledge on UI/UX on a Figma project doing Wireframes and Hi-Fidelity version of the web, applying mobile-first. 

## Backend Section üëæ
You can find all the documentation related to the backend development (installation, exection, structure, etc.) on its own [**README.md**](https://github.com/Ruben35/notes-fullstack/tree/main/backend#backend-api-for-notes-) inside `backend` folder.

## Frontend Section üñºÔ∏è
You can find all the documentation related to the frontend development (installation, exection, guide, etc.) on its own [**README.md**](https://github.com/Ruben35/notes-fullstack/tree/main/frontend#frontend-for-notes-%EF%B8%8F) inside `frontend` folder.

## UI/UX Section üß©
The inspiration of doing this design was the one of my favourite apps that is **Notion**, so that's why the app is very monocromatic but respecting the usage of alert colors.
